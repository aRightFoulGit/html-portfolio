The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp -  Capstone Project 1 - CV Basic HTML

## Instructions: “Build A multi-page website exclusively in basic HTML.”

The project was to create a Resume/CV webpage. To be honest at this stage in the game, I have literally nothing (other than what you see) to show for it.

I am learning Web Development / Full Stack as means to potentially change my career path.

To be very honest, with the rise of Ai tools, etc. I really don’t know if I can ever be a contender in this arena. But, I’m about to find out.
